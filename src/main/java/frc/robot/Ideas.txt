Ideas for the Robot (Things we want or need to add)

- Automatically close Hood when close to trench
- Climber
- Autoalign to hub
- Autos
- 


Unfinished things for the Robot (Things that have been started but need work)

- Hood PID (I don't think we can ork on this yet, but I could be wrong)
- Shooter RPM values (testing necessary)






Josiah's tasks
 - Finish setting up all motors with position and speed logging
 - Add PID support to relevant subsystems (Shooter, Hood, Intake Deployment, Climber)
 - 

Testing
 - PID control for hood
 - Simulation
 - Limelight localization
 - 

Simulation tasks
 - Add all motor simulation equivalents
 - Get PID simulation working
 - Add all simulation systems
 - Add subsystem visuals
 - 

Other tasks
 - Teleop pathplanning
